# Innovative Idea
Our idea is for a music discovery application that allows you to listen to a random song and give it a rating. This website would use an api from some music provider's database with various genres and artists, so you can explore and discover new music. After rating a song, the website saves your rating, allowing you to keep track of your listening history and revisit the songs you liked. A lot of other applications give you recommendations based on your interests but ours will be random so you discover new songs you may have never listened to otherwise.
