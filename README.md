# Innovative Idea
Our idea is for a music discovery application that allows you to listen to a random song and give it a rating. This website would use an api from some music provider's database with various genres and artists, so you can explore and discover new music. After rating a song, the website saves your rating, allowing you to keep track of your listening history and revisit the songs you liked. A lot of other applications give you recommendations based on your interests but ours will be random so you discover new songs you may have never listened to otherwise.

# Data
The type of data that our application will include are:

songs - a song data type will be the audio file of a song and additional information such as its artist, the album art, as well as genre tags that describe the music.

ratings - a rating data type will be a numerical value signifying a user's satisfaction of the song out of 5 stars and an optional comment that is saved for the user's viewing and also given to the song.

genre - a genre data type organizes songs from the database into popular catergories that the user can select.

playlist - a playlist data type stores songs which the user can add to make different playlists out of songs that they like.
